HYPEPAD Full Presale Integration Bundle

Includes:
- index.html: Main homepage updated with links to $HYPE Presale and unified launch/IDO page.
- presale_ui.html: Interactive presale dashboard with wallet connect stub (MetaMask via ethers.js), vesting calculator (three tiers), claim panel showing allocation, vested, claimable, and sample logic.
- hype_presale.html: Standalone presale landing page linking into dashboard.
- assets/hypepad-banner-integrated.jpg: branding banner.
- logo-192.png, favicon.ico: brand icons.

Next steps:
1. Replace placeholder contract references and implement real on-chain calls using your presale and $HYPE token contract ABIs.
2. Hook up wallet interaction beyond stub to enable participation and claiming.
3. Adjust vesting parameters if your real schedule differs; update the calculator logic accordingly.
4. Deploy these files; ensure the root contains logo-192.png and favicon.ico.
5. Update navigation on other pages to link to index.html or presale_ui.html as appropriate.
