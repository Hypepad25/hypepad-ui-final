HYPEPAD QUICK FIXES BUNDLE

Included:
- Header.jsx : responsive header React component with mobile menu, wallet button, logo placeholder, and badges.
- HeroSection.jsx : updated hero section component with layout, slogan, CTA, and banner.
- styles.css : standalone CSS for non-React fallback (header + hero + general theming).

Instructions:
1. For React project:
   - Copy Header.jsx and HeroSection.jsx into your components folder.
   - Import and render in your App, e.g.:
     import Header from './components/Header';
     import HeroSection from './components/HeroSection';
     <Header />
     <HeroSection />
   - Ensure assets exist: /logo-192.png, /hypepad-banner.jpg
   - Build and deploy.

2. For static fallback:
   - Include styles.css in <head>:
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css" />
   - Inline header HTML (see previous message) and hero HTML.
   - Replace logo and banner placeholders.

3. Add SEO JSON-LD in head as needed:
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"WebApplication",
  "name":"HYPEPAD Launchpad",
  "url":"https://yourdomain.com",
  "description":"Multi-chain token launchpad with rug-proof graduation, security, and growth tools for creators and investors."
}
</script>

4. Commit & push to trigger deployment.
